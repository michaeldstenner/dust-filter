# NAME

df2000 - dust filter controller

# SYNOPSIS

| df2000 [-h] [--version]

# DESCRIPTION


## Program-level arguments

-h, --help
:   Print a summary of commands and options, then exit.

--version
:   Show the program's version and exit.  This will attempt to provide
    detailed version information, especially when run in container
    mode.  In that case, it will print both the version of the system
    installed on the host, but also the version being run within the
    container.

# DF2000.YAML

By default, *df2000* will search the following locations for config
file content:

    <df2000 python package path; these are the defaults>
    /etc/df2000.yaml

The system will read *all* of the config files it finds, and overlay
content.  The version installed in the package directory provides the
distributed defaults and should not be edited.  This version is well
commented and is currently the best documentation for the conguration.
